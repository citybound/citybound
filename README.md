# Design Documentation

*This repository contains not only the code of Citybound, but also a detailed **Design Doc**, describing the philosophy and decisions taken for design and implementation. It is interwoven with the code, to make it clear which abstract parts of the game are implemented where. Just follow the link below to get started.*

***Just like the code, the Design Doc is open for contribution.** You can suggest changes by making a pull request, which can be discussed and refined before deciding if it will be taken fully, partially, or not - documenting the whole decision process publicly.*
